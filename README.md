KLC compliance is established using KiCAD's official scripts within the "kicad-library-utils" folder and the "lib_check.sh" script

Compliance for the purposes of this library is defined as zero errors for footprints and symbols. Reasonable warnings about pin position or names may be accepted.

## Installation instructions

Open the KiCAD Plugin and Content Manager (PCM), click "Manage..." in the top right, and add the following URL to your list of repositories:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hlord2000/hlord2000-kicad-repository/main/repository.json
```
Then, using the dropdown in the PCM, switch to "hlord2000's KiCAD Repository" and click on the "Libraries" tab.
