KLC compliance is established using KiCAD's official scripts within the "kicad-library-utils" folder and the "lib_check.sh" script

Compliance for the purposes of this library is defined as zero errors for footprints and symbols. Reasonable warnings about pin position or names may be accepted.

## Seeking pull-requests for any footprint/symbol/3D model marked 🚧
